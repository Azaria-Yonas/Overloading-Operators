# Basics of Operator Overloading in C++

## Overview

This repository shows the basics of a operator overloading in C++. It features a simple class named "Vector," that has two  private data members: Xcoordinate and Y coordinate. Here, we'll see how we can overload operator in order to compare and perform operations on them. 

### Note

Before proceeding, make sure you are familiar with classes, constructors, pointers, encapsulation, etc.

## Features

- **Relational Operators**
  - Greator-than
  - Less-than
  - Equal-to.




- **Arithmetic Operators**
  - Addition 
  - Subtraction
  

## Getting Started

 - Run the code and see what happens!

### Prerequisites

- C++ 13.1.0
- An IDE + Complier (e.g., g++)
